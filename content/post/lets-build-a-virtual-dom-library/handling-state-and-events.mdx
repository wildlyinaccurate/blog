In this next section, we're going to implement a **very na√Øve** and **very inefficient** mechanism for handling state updates within our components. The basic idea will be to make our base `Component` class trigger a re-render whenever the `setState` method is called, and replace the existing component DOM with the new VDOM tree. This is quite wasteful and sort-of defeats the purpose of a virtual DOM library, but we're going to build it anyway as a learning exercise. In the next section, we'll implement a reconciliation algorithm, which will make our updates much more efficient.

The first thing we're going to do is modify our `createVNode()` function.
