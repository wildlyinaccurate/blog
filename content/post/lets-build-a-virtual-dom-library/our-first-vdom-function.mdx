title: Our first VDOM function

Now that we understand what the virtual DOM is, we can write our first function:

```js
function createVNode(type, props, children) {
    return {
        type,
        props,
        children,
    };
}
```

This function probably seems so simple that it's almost not necessary - all it's doing is turning the function arguments into object properties. As we continue writing our virtual DOM library, this function will change and will have a few different variations. For now, we can just enjoy that it is so simple.

So how do we actually use this function? Let's start with something simple: a VDOM tree that represents a `<h1>` element containing the text `Hello, World!`.

```js
createVNode("h1", null, ["Hello, World!"]);
```

Simple! This function call will return a VDOM tree that looks like this:

```js
{
    "type": "h1",
    "props": null,
    "children": [
        "Hello, World!"
    ]
}
```

To make things interesting, let's build a VDOM tree with a bit more depth, and a combination of text and elements.

```js
createVNode("div", { className: "container" }, [
    createVNode("h1", null, ["Hello, World!"]),
    createVNode("p", null, [
        "We're building a ",
        createVNode("small", null, ["(really simple)"]),
        " virtual DOM library.",
    ]),
]);
```

And here's what the VDOM tree will look like:

```js
{
    "type": "div",
    "props": {
        "className": "container"
    },
    "children": [
        {
            "type": "h1",
            "props": null,
            "children": [
                "Hello, World!"
            ]
        },
        {
            "type": "p",
            "props": null,
            "children": [
                "We're building a ",
                {
                    "type": "small",
                    "props": null,
                    "children": [
                        "(really simple)"
                    ]
                },
                " virtual DOM library."
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Now we know how easy it is to build a virtual representation of a DOM tree. But this representation by itself is not very useful. In the next section we're going to write the code that mounts a VDOM tree into the real DOM.
